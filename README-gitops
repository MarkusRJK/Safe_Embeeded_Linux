Ignored files:
- are always ignored as new files only (if not yet in repo)
- if force added to repo and later changed they behave like normal files in repo
- use git add file -f to force add ignored files

Files in Repo:
- if file is in both repos (with different content), it is "replaced"
  when switching
- if file is in one repo but not the other, it is removed when switching
- if a file is not in this repo but the other, switching gets it out.

Strategy for Small Linux repo:
- put all files into .gitignore
- if a file of .gitignore needs to be added, use git add file -f IN ALL
  branches (otherwise it will be deleted once you switch)
- now this file behaves like a normal file

Switching Branches:
- Ensure that any added files after branching off will be added to the target
  branch
